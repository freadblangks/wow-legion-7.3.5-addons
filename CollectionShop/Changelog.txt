**2.06**

- Release date: 10/01/2017
- Bug fix: Four variables were being accidentally put into global namespace. For most users this had no effect, but for others it may have caused minor taint issues.

**2.05**

- Release date: 08/31/2017
- New items added for patch 7.3.0.

**2.03**

- Release date: 08/04/2017
- Reduced number of Appearance detection retries for armor and weapons during GetAll and Live scans. This should prevent long pauses on realms that happen to have a large amount of armor or weapons that cannot be transmogged.
- Minor change to Help tab.

**2.02**

- Release date: 07/18/2017
- Bug fix: In rare situations an Appearance Shop would get stuck at "Filtering, one moment please...".

**2.01**

- Release date: 07/18/2017
- Bug fix: In some cases not all Sources were being gathered to determine if an Appearance was collected (API inconsistencies) and may have returned Collected items as being Not Collected.
- Bug fix: Rarely a noticable effect but in the event an Appearance Shop was performed within a few seconds of login or reload the number of results may have been reduced. The internal timeout has been increased for checking Sources to compensate for the game's info lag during that time.
- Live checkbox now disabled while scanning to prevent accidental cancellation of a GetAll scan.

**2.0**

- Release date: 07/16/2017
- Time since last scan will now show "Live" in green when the Live checkbox is checked instead of showing the last time a GetAll scan was performed.
- Around 20% less auctions are stored for comparison during scanning. They are simply not needed because they are not a Mount, Pet, Toy, or Appearance.
- Around 10% more results will be shown in an Appearance mode Shop. This is due to no longer restricting Sources by type and also the inclusion of hidden Sources that Blizzard deems unobtainable or otherwise chooses to hide.
- Appearances mode no longer immediately starts updating when choosing a mode. A faster modified updating from your collection is performed during Shop once after each GetAll scan or every time you perform a Live scan.
- Added Mounts portrait to Options frame.
- The change mode button (top left on AH tab) is now disabled while scanning to prevent accidental cancellation of a GetAll scan.
- GetAll data for all realms will be wiped due to changes in required information.

**1.06**

- Release date: 10/02/2016
- Bug fix: A very few Appearances were showing as Not Collected even when they were due to being "Collected" in one Appearance category while being "Not Collected" in another. Thanks to Curse user Tarasitarik for reporting this issue.

**1.05**

- Improved detection of Not Collected vs Collected on Mounts and Toys

**1.04**

**1.02**

- Release date: 09/08/2016
- Bug fix: Rare Lua error on slow connections caused by previous increase in filter retry attempts.
- Bug fix: Sometimes on slow connections, auctions were said to be no longer available when really there was just not enough time given to find the information required. Increased retry attempts to compensate, this should no longer happen.

**1.01**

- Release date: 09/07/2016
- Bug fix: Occasionally items Already known would be listed as Not Collected due to slow response in retrieving item information. I've increased retry attempts to retrieve item information for filters to avoid inaccurate results. Should an item still fail during filtering a chat message will be shown.

**1.0**

- Release date: 09/05/2016
- Intial release.

    Add safeguard to prevent redundant updates from being triggered
    
    As the rewards data can only change if the weekly chest is being looted,
    this should be sufficient.
    
    In the rare case that it's the first login for the week, any of the
    regular BAG_UPDATE events (on login) will trigger the update as it is.

    Stop writing duplicate LFR lockout entries to the DB
    
    Only the regular LFR lockouts will be omitted, so that the legacy LFR
    handling continues to function as it did previously.
